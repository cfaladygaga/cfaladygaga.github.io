# Lady Gaga Website

## About the project
This project was developed in 24h during the 2023 edition of the Hackathon of the Code for All_ bootcamp #91 && #93. The theme was "Super Bowl" and we were randomly selected to create a project related with Lady Gaga. We as a team decided we wanted to create a website that would be a tribute to Lady Gaga and her career. This website included a short but complete biograpgy, a paint project that users can interact with and a piano tiles game with her music. This all done in a very interactive, responsive and user friendly way.
